## Hello, guys :wave:

:cherry_blossom: I'm studying to be a front-end dev :computer:

I am currently learning JS, Big-O Notation. 
At the end of last year (2020), I learned HTML5, CSS3 and the basics of Programming Logic. In addition to JS, the next step is to study Data Structure and Front-end Frameworks (React and Angular, which, by the way, I will start studying in March 2021 - next month).

I am still a newcomer in the area of ​​information technology, however I can give advice on career change (end of last year, I finally decided to go to the area of ​​i.t. I was in the legal area, studying for public exam ...) , help with something about front-end technology, in case I don't know, I can research (I'm a good researcher). Soon, I want to study English again.
